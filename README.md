## PoliSwirl is a swirl course created to expand upon the data science knowledge of political science majors. The course goes over wrangling political data, using R-Studio to create maps and plot data onto them, as well as communicating using R-markdown. PoliSwirl is intended to build off of the current [swirl course repository](https://swirlstats.com/scn/title.html)

*This course was created as the Final Project for Isabella Bingaman in Ryan T. Moore's GOV 496 Fall Semester Course*
