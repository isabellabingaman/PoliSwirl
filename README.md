## PoliSwirl is a swirl course created to expand upon the data science knowledge of political science majors. The course goes over wrangling political data, using R-Studio to create maps and plot data onto them, as well as communicating using R-markdown. PoliSwirl is intended to build off of the current [swirl course repository](https://swirlstats.com/scn/title.html).  

### The course contains 4 lessons:   
1. Introduction  
  * Which serves to introduce the user to the course, including familiarizing them with some of the data placed in their workspace.  
2. Wrangling  
  * Which serves to teach users how to wrangle political data to work for them.  
3. ModelingMaps  
  * Which serves to teach users the preliminary process of modeling political data on maps.  
4. Communicating  
  * Which serves to teach users how to communicate their findings using R-Markdown.  

I welcome and _encourage_ suggestions, improvements, and additions to the course.  Feel free to clone, branch, and send me a pull request!  

*This course was created as the Final Project for Isabella Bingaman in Ryan T. Moore's GOV 496 Fall Semester Course*
