- Class: video
  Output: If you have a hard time understanding data analysis using statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and probability, enlist in the Statistical Inference Swirl Course

- Class: text
  Output: R-markdown files are the most effective for actually communicating your analysis. An R-markdown file can be created by saving a text file with the extension .Rmd or can be opened directly via R-studio. 

- Class: text
  Output: The information contained in the header (called a YAML header) is important for documenting the file. R-studio will create the YAML header template for you.

- Class: text
  Output: The most common output arguments in the YAML header are html_document, pdf_document, and word_document, though it is also possible to create a slideshow within markdown.

- Class: text
  Output: By typing directly into a markdown file, you create plain text that will be displayed in the output. 

- Class: text
  Output: This text can be customized with *italics*, **bold**, superscript^2^ and ~~strikethrough~~. 

- Class: text_question
  Output: How would we enter the text "Do your homework" into an r-markdown so that it appears with a strike through it in the output?
  CorrectAnswer: ~~Do your homework~~
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='~~Do your homework~~')
  Hint: Put the phrase "Do your homework" inside ~~ and ~~ 

- Class: text
  Output: We indicate the size of our titles/headers with #, where only one creates the # Largest Text, two creates a ## Bit Smaller, and three ### Even Smaller. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which would look physically larger in the markdown output?
  AnswerChoices: # Title ;## TITLE;### Title 
  CorrectAnswer: # Title
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='# Title')
  Hint: Pay attention to the hashtags. 

- Class: text
  Output: To make a list, we can use * For bullet points and 1. For numbered lists, where sub-points can be identified with a + 

- Class: text
  Output: We can also hyperlink by putting the link text in [square brackets] directly followed by the actual link (in parentheses). For example, if I wanted to hyperlink the word Google to Google.com, I would type [Google](Google.com).
  

- Class: text
  Output: Now for the tricky part, embedding our code right in to the output. 

- Class: text
  Output: If we wish to include simple inline code, it can be enclosed in `backticks` to be embedded into the report. 

- Class: text
  Output: To insert a code chunk, which is more realistically how we will share our analysis... start a chunk with ```{r} and end with ``` when the code is complete. 

- Class: text
  Output: With no specifications, embedding this code chunk will reproduce the code used as well as the output created. 

- Class: text
  Output: When you'd like to display your code, but not the output created... add eval = FALSE into the ```{r} lead. No need for commas or other syntax!

- Class: text
  Output: If we want to print the output of the code we used, but not reproduce the actual code... include echo = FALSE into the ```{r} lead. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which would produce the dimensions of ANES data without the code needed to produce it? 
  AnswerChoices: ...echo = FALSE} dim(ANES);...eval = FALSE} dim(ANES) ```;...echo = TRUE} dim(ANES) ```
  CorrectAnswer: ...echo = FALSE} dim(ANES) ```
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='...echo = FALSE} dim(ANES) ```')
  Hint: Pay attention to echo versus eval 

- Class: text
  Output: If you want to avoid printing warning or error messages associated with the code, use the warning = FALSE and/or error = FALSE arguments in the ```{r} lead. 

- Class: text
  Output: Sometimes, we want to run code in the background without printing the code or the output... to do this, we use include = FALSE in the ```{r} lead. 

- Class: text
  Output: We can include #comments in the chunks of r-code that we include in our markdown, but they will be included in the output so remember to comment judiciously. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What would be displayed by this code chunk in the output?... ```{r include = FALSE} 2 + 2 ```
  AnswerChoices: Nothing;The number 4;The line 2+2 as well as the number 4 
  CorrectAnswer: Nothing
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Nothing')
  Hint: Type a hint.

- Class: text_question
  Output: How would I enter in the word "Statistics" to make sure it comes out as bolded in my markdown output?
  CorrectAnswer: **Statistics***
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Nothing')
  Hint: Put the word Statistics inside ** and **


- Class: text_question
  Output: What would we type into our R-markdown file to hyperlink the word "Cheeseburger" to a website whose address is www.mcdonalds.com  
  CorrectAnswer: [Cheeseburger](www.mcdonalds.com)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='Nothing')
  Hint: Put the term cheeseburger in square brackets directly followed by www.mcdonalds.com in parentheses. Note that there should be no space in between the two.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If I created a bullet point named "To-Do List", which character would I use to create a sub-item "Homework"?
  AnswerChoices: + Homework;1. Homework;* Homework
  CorrectAnswer: + Homework
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='+ Homework')
  Hint: Remember which symbol ADDs as sub-item

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If I wanted to include a graph of the U.S. that I created in my R-markdown output, but not the code that I used to create it, which argument should I use?
  AnswerChoices: echo = FALSE;eval = FALSE;include = FALSE
  CorrectAnswer: echo = FALSE
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='echo = FALSE')
  Hint: Type a hint.

- Class: mult_question
  Output: If I want to show an example of an error message created by the use of certain code, which argument should I use?  
  AnswerChoices: error = TRUE;error = FALSE;warning = TRUE
  CorrectAnswer: error = TRUE
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal='error = TRUE')
  Hint: Remember the difference between errors and warnings 

- Class: text
  Output: When we are ready to share our R-markdown file, its as simple as selecting "Knit". When you knit the markdown file, R will execute all of the code imbedded in the file and insert the results as appropriate. It will also create a word document, pdf, html or other that will be pulled up for preview as well as saved into the current working directory. 

- Class: text
  Output: One of the most common errors in knitting R-markdown files is confusing the information in your current console with the information provided in the file. An R-markdown cannot execute without loading the necessary packages, datasets, etc. to reproduce the code. Think of it as someone running your code in a brand new R-session. 

- Class: text
  Output: Once you've created your knitted .Rmd file and desired output, if you have the need to submit just the code used to create your report, the purl() function comes in handy. 

- Class: text
  Output: The first argument in purl() identifies the .Rmd file you'd like to purl "in quotations". That in itself is sufficient, but if you wish to include the name of the new destination of the .R file containing your code, use the output = argument and name your .R file "in quotes"

- Class: text
  Output: For example, if I wanted to purl an .Rmd file named Statistics.Rmd and my output be placed in a file named "PurledStats.R", I could run the code purl("Statistics.Rmd", output = "PurledStats.R"). This, of course, is all within the current working directory. 

- Class: video
  Output: If you'd like to learn more about the way R-markdown works, there are extremely helpful "cheat sheets" online to check out.
